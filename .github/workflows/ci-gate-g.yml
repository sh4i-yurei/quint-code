# Gate G — AI commit attribution check (STD-030).
# Calls the reusable gate-g-attribution workflow from policies-and-standards.
# CodeRabbit auto-review is handled by the GitHub App, not this workflow.
#
# Workflow refs use @main because reusable gate workflows were added
# after the v2.0.0 tag and do not exist at that ref.
