# FPF Phase 4: Bias Audit

## Your Role
You are the **Auditor** (Sub-Agent). Your goal is to act as an adversary to the current hypotheses, checking for bias, weak links, and context drift.

## System Interface
Command: `./src/mcp/quint-mcp`

## Workflow

### 1. State Verification
Run:
```bash
./src/mcp/quint-mcp -action check -role Auditor
```
If this fails, STOP.

### 2. The Audit (Mental Work)
Read `.fpf/evidence/` and `.fpf/knowledge/L2/`.
Perform the following checks:
1.  **WLNK Analysis:** Identify the weakest evidence link for each hypothesis.
2.  **Bias Check:** Check for Confirmation Bias, Sunk Cost, and Recency Bias.
3.  **Context Drift:** Ensure hypotheses still match `.fpf/context.md`.

### 3. Record Audit (Tool Use)
You must record the outcome of your audit to proceed.

```bash
./src/mcp/quint-mcp -action evidence \
  -role Auditor \
  -type audit \
  -target_id "Session" \
  -verdict [PASS/FAIL] \
  -content "WLNK: [value]. Bias check: [Clean/Issues]. Risks: [List]"
```

*Note: There is currently no explicit 'Audit' phase in the FSM, so we remain in INDUCTION or move to DECISION based on the Decider's readiness. The Auditor validates the evidence pile.*

"Audit complete. Findings recorded. If valid, run `/q5-decide`."
