# FPF Phase 5: Decide (Finalize & Document)

## Phase Gate (MANDATORY)

**STOP. Verify phase before proceeding:**

1. Read `.fpf/session.md`, extract `Phase:` value
2. Check validity:

| Current Phase | Can Run? | Action |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| AUDIT_COMPLETE | ✅ YES | Proceed |
| INDUCTION_COMPLETE | ⚠️ YES with WARNING | See below |
| Any other | ❌ NO | See below |

**If AUDIT_COMPLETE:** Proceed normally.

**If INDUCTION_COMPLETE (audit skipped):**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Proceeding without bias audit.

You are skipping /fpf-4-audit. This means:
- No systematic WLNK calculation performed
- No bias check conducted  
- No adversarial analysis done
- Evidence quality not reviewed

This is ACCEPTABLE for:
- Low-stakes, easily reversible decisions
- Time-critical situations where audit overhead isn't justified

This is RISKY for:
- Architectural decisions with long-term consequences
- Decisions affecting multiple teams or systems
- Anything that's hard to reverse

Do you want to:
1. Proceed anyway → Continue with /fpf-5-decide
2. Run audit first → /fpf-4-audit

Awaiting your confirmation to proceed without audit.
```

**Wait for explicit human confirmation before proceeding.**

**If earlier phase:**
```
⛔ BLOCKED: Cannot decide without evidence.
Current phase: [PHASE]

Required steps:
- INITIALIZED → /fpf-1-hypothesize
- ABDUCTION_COMPLETE → /fpf-2-check  
- DEDUCTION_COMPLETE → /fpf-3-test or /fpf-3-research
- INDUCTION_COMPLETE → /fpf-4-audit (recommended) or proceed with warning

Complete required phases first.
```

## Your Role

Synthesize the ADI cycle into a **Design Rationale Record (DRR)** — a permanent, auditable decision document.

**Critical Transformer Mandate:** You present options and evidence. **Human decides.** You do not make the final choice autonomously.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] At least one hypothesis at L1+ status
- [ ] Evidence exists for key claims
- [ ] No unresolved blocker issues (if audit was run)
- [ ] Human is ready to make decision

## Process

### 1. Present Decision Point to Human

If multiple hypotheses remain viable, present comparison:

```markdown
## Decision Point — AWAITING YOUR INPUT

### Viable Candidates

| Hypothesis | Status | R_eff (WLNK) | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|--------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| H1: [name] | L2 | 0.85 | [+] | [-] |
| H2: [name] | L1 | 0.70 | [+] | [-] |
| H3: [name] | L1 | 0.60 | [+] | [-] |

### Evidence Summary

**H1 evidence:**
- [evidence 1]: [finding]
- [evidence 2]: [finding]

**H2 evidence:**
- [evidence 1]: [finding]

### Trade-off Analysis

| Dimension | H1 | H2 | H3 |
|-----------|----|----|-----|
| Effort | [estimate] | [estimate] | [estimate] |
| Risk | [level] | [level] | [level] |
| Reversibility | [easy/hard] | [easy/hard] | [easy/hard] |
| WLNK R_eff | [value] | [value] | [value] |

### My Assessment

Based on evidence, **H1** appears strongest because:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

However, **H2** might be preferred if:
- [Condition where H2 wins]

### Your Decision Required

**Which hypothesis should we proceed with?**

Options:
1. **H1: [name]** — [one-line summary]
2. **H2: [name]** — [one-line summary]  
3. **H3: [name]** — [one-line summary]
4. **None** — Need more information / Start new cycle

Please indicate your choice.
```

**STOP HERE. Wait for human response.**

### 2. Create DRR (After Human Decides)

Once human confirms choice, create `.fpf/decisions/DRR-[NNN]-[slug].md`:

```markdown
---
id: DRR-[NNN]
title: "[Decision Title]"
status: ACCEPTED
date: [timestamp]
decision_makers:
  - "[Human — name/role if known]"
  - "Claude — as analyst/advisor"
supersedes: [previous DRR if any, or "none"]
hypothesis_selected: "[hypothesis id]"
alternatives_rejected: ["[id1]", "[id2]"]
---

## DRR Quality Checklist

| Quality | Check | ✓/✗ |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Traceable** | Can follow from decision → evidence → tests → hypotheses? | |
| **Complete** | All considered alternatives documented? | |
| **Actionable** | Clear what to implement? | |
| **Bounded** | Validity conditions specified? | |
| **Reversible** | Know when/how to revisit? | |
| **Attributed** | Human decision-maker identified? | |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Decided by Claude" | Violates Transformer Mandate | Always attribute to human |
| No rejected alternatives | Looks like rubber-stamping | Document all considered options |
| Missing validity conditions | Decision becomes stale silently | Specify re-evaluation triggers |
| No evidence references | Untraceable, unauditable | Link to specific evidence files |
| Proceeding without human choice | Autonomous decision-making | Always wait for explicit human selection |
| Skipping audit without acknowledgment | Hidden risk | Explicitly note if audit was skipped |
