## [4.0.0] - 2025-12-18

### MCP Server Architecture

This release introduces the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server as the core of Quint Code, replacing the previous prompt-only approach. The server provides structured tools for AI assistants to interact with the FPF knowledge base.

### Breaking Changes

- **Project Directory:** Renamed from `.fpf` to `.quint`. Migration: run `/q-actualize` to migrate, then delete `.fpf`.

### Added

- **MCP Server** (`quint-code serve`):
  - `quint_init` — Initialize project structure and bounded context
  - `quint_transition` — Phase transitions with role and evidence validation
  - `quint_propose` — Create hypotheses with scope and kind classification
  - `quint_evidence` — Record evidence with assurance level, carrier reference, and validity window
  - `quint_loopback` — Induction → Deduction refinement cycle
  - `quint_decide` — Create Decision Rationale Records (DRR) with E.9 fields
  - `quint_status` — Query current cycle state
  - `quint_query` — Search knowledge base
  - `quint_audit` — Visualize assurance tree with R-scores
  - `quint_decay` — Calculate epistemic debt from expired evidence
  - `quint_actualize` — Reconcile knowledge base with code changes
  - `quint_reset` — Discard current reasoning cycle

- **CLI** (`quint-code init`):
  - Project initialization with `.quint/` directory structure
  - MCP configuration for Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI
  - Slash command installation (global or per-project)

- **SQLite Database** (`quint.db`):
  - `holons` table with `scope`, `kind`, `cached_r_score` columns
  - `evidence` table with `valid_until` for decay tracking
  - `relations` table with `congruence_level` for WLNK calculation

- **Assurance Calculator**:
  - Weakest Link (WLNK) — R-score capped by lowest dependency
  - Congruence Penalty — Low-congruence relations reduce reliability
  - Evidence Decay — Expired evidence penalizes R-score
  - Cycle detection for circular dependencies

- **Typed Reasoning (Kind-CAL)**:
  - Hypotheses classified as `system` (code/architecture) or `episteme` (knowledge/theory)
  - Validation logic branches based on kind

- **Characteristic Space (C.16)**:
  - Success metrics defined before testing
  - Metrics measured during induction
  - Results recorded in DRR

- **Multi-platform Support**:
  - Claude Code (`.mcp.json`, `~/.claude/commands/`)
  - Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.cursor/commands/`)
  - Gemini CLI (`~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.gemini/commands/`)
  - Codex CLI (`~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/prompts/`)

## [3.4.0] - 2025-12-15

### Security: Executable Phase Gating

#### Physics-First Enforcement (`/q1-hypothesize`)

- **Vulnerability Closed:** Previous prompts used "soft" text instructions to prevent adding hypotheses mid-cycle, which "helpful" AI models would bypass.
- **Executable Gate:** Now injects a bash script that checks `.quint/session.md`. If the phase is locked (Deduction/Induction complete), the script exits with `1`.
- **Hard Stop:** The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to treat a script failure as a hard stop ("Physics says no"), preventing "helpfulness bias" overrides.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added: Legacy Project Repair

#### Smart Initialization (`/q0-init`)

- **Self-Healing Capability:** The init command now detects incomplete FPF setups (e.g., legacy projects missing `context.md` from v2.x).
- **Deterministic Diagnostic:** Injects a bash script to verify file existence before deciding actions, preventing AI "hallucinated" skips.
- **Repair Mode:** If `.quint/` exists but is incomplete, it triggers a surgical repair (generating only missing files) while preserving existing session data.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added: Process Hardening & Flexibility

#### Strict Phase Gating (FPF Integrity)

- **Hard Block in `/q1-hypothesize`:** Explicitly forbids generating new hypotheses if the cycle has passed Deduction. This prevents the "Helpfulness Bias" vulnerability where AI assistants might break process integrity to be "nice".
- **Conditional Logic in `/q2-check`:** The cycle phase now only advances to `DEDUCTION_COMPLETE` when *all* active L0 hypotheses are resolved. If any remain unchecked, the door stays open for extensions.

#### New Command: `/q1-extend`

- **Legitimate Extension Path:** A dedicated command to add a missed hypothesis during the `ABDUCTION_COMPLETE` phase.
- **Safety Rails:** Strictly blocked once `DEDUCTION_COMPLETE` is reached, ensuring evidence integrity (WLNK validity) during testing.

### Changed

- **Updated `/q-status`:** State machine visualization now includes the `(q1-extend)` loop.
- **Refined `/q3-test` & `/q3-research`:** Reinforced checks to ensure testing only happens after deduction is fully complete.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added: Deep Reasoning Capabilities

#### Context Slicing (A.2.6)

- **Structured Context:** `.quint/context.md` is now structured into explicit slices:
  - **Slice: Grounding** (Infrastructure, Region)
  - **Slice: Tech Stack** (Language, Frameworks)
  - **Slice: Constraints** (Compliance, Budget, Team)
- **Context-Aware Init:** `/q0-init` now scans `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, etc., to auto-populate slices.

#### Explicit Role Injection (A.2)

- **Role-Swapping Prompts:** Commands now enforce specific FPF roles to prevent "AI drift":
  - `/q1-hypothesize`: **ExplorerRole** (Creative, Abductive)
  - `/q2-check`: **LogicianRole** (Strict, Deductive)
  - `/q4-audit`: **AuditorRole** (Adversarial, Normative)

#### Context Drift Analysis

- **New Audit Step:** `/q4-audit` now includes a mandatory **Context Drift Check**.
- **Validation:** Verifies that hypotheses generated in step 1 still match the constraints in step 4 (preventing "works on my machine" architecture).

### Changed

- **Command Prompts:** Updated `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, `q4` to enforce the new reasoning standards.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-14

### Major Breaking Change: Rebrand to Quint Code

**Crucible Code is now Quint Code.**

### Why the Name Change?

1. **Avoid Collision:** "Crucible" is an existing code review tool by Atlassian. We want a distinct identity.
2. **Not Just Code:** This tool melts *ideas* and *reasoning*, not just source code.
3. **The "Quintessence":** Anatoly Levenchuk described this project as a "distillate of FPF" (~5% of the full framework). It is the *quintessence*—the concentrated essence of the methodology.
4. **The Invariant Quintet:** FPF is built on five invariants (IDEM, COMM, LOC, WLNK, MONO). Quint Code enforces a rigid 5-step sequence (`q1`–`q5`) to preserve these invariants in your reasoning.

### Changed

- **Project Name**: `crucible-code` → `quint-code`
- **Commands Prefix**: `/fpf-*` → `/q*`
  - `/q0-init`
  - `/q1-hypothesize`
  - `/q2-check`
  - `/q3-test`
  - `/q3-research`
  - `/q4-audit`
  - `/q5-decide`
- **Utility Commands**:
  - `/fpf-status` → `/q-status`
  - `/fpf-query` → `/q-query`
  - `/fpf-decay` → `/q-decay`
  - `/fpf-discard` → `/q-reset` (Renamed to avoid tab-completion clash with decay)

### Migration Guide

1. **Delete old commands**: Run the uninstall script or manually delete `~/.claude/commands/fpf-*`.
2. **Install new commands**: Run `./install.sh`.
3. **Update mental model**: Think "Quintet" (5 invariants, 5 steps).

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

#### Multi-Platform Support

- **Four AI coding tools supported**: Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI
- **Adapter-based build system**: Source commands in `src/commands/`, platform-specific outputs in `dist/`
- **Platform adapters**: Transform markdown to platform-specific formats (TOML for Gemini, etc.)

#### Interactive TUI Installer

- **`curl | bash` one-liner install**: `curl -fsSL https://...install.sh | bash -s -- -g`
- **Interactive platform selection**: Choose which AI tools to install commands for
- **Global and per-project modes**: `-g` flag for global install, default for project-local
- **Vim-style navigation**: Arrow keys and j/k for selection
- **Bash 3.x compatibility**: Works on macOS default shell (no associative arrays)

#### Uninstall Functionality

- **`--uninstall` flag**: Remove installed FPF commands

- **SVG banner for GitHub**: `assets/banner.svg` with same gradient colors
- **Cleaner TUI**: Simplified instructions, highlighted keys

### Changed

- **Directory structure**: Commands moved from `commands/` to `src/commands/` (source of truth)
- **Installation targets**: Installer copies from `dist/{platform}/` not source
- **README**: Updated with new install instructions and SVG banner

### Notes

This was the initial implementation based on the First Principles Framework (FPF) specification. The focus was on establishing the core workflow and making FPF accessible to developers through Claude Code commands.

Key design decisions:

- Commands over subagents (human must be in the loop)
- File-based persistence (git-trackable)
- Minimal tooling (no external dependencies)
- Advisory guidance (not enforced gates)

---

## Upgrade Notes

### 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

**Session file format changed.** Existing `.quint/session.md` files should be updated to include:

- Phase Transitions Log table
- Valid Phase Transitions diagram reference

**Evidence files should add:**

- `congruence:` block for external evidence
- `valid_until:` if not already present

**No breaking changes to:**

- Knowledge directory structure
- DRR format (only additions)
- Command names and basic arguments

**Recommended migration:**

1. Run `/fpf-decay` to identify evidence needing validity dates
2. Add congruence assessment to existing external evidence
3. No need to re-run completed cycles
