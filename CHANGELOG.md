# Changelog

All notable changes to Crucible Code will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

#### Multi-Platform Support

- **Four AI coding tools supported**: Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI
- **Adapter-based build system**: Source commands in `src/commands/`, platform-specific outputs in `dist/`
- **Platform adapters**: Transform markdown to platform-specific formats (TOML for Gemini, etc.)

#### Interactive TUI Installer

- **`curl | bash` one-liner install**: `curl -fsSL https://...install.sh | bash -s -- -g`
- **Interactive platform selection**: Choose which AI tools to install commands for
- **Global and per-project modes**: `-g` flag for global install, default for project-local
- **Vim-style navigation**: Arrow keys and j/k for selection
- **Bash 3.x compatibility**: Works on macOS default shell (no associative arrays)

#### Uninstall Functionality

- **`--uninstall` flag**: Remove installed FPF commands
- **Auto-detection**: Finds commands in both global and local locations
- **Platform-specific cleanup**: Only removes selected platforms

#### CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions workflow**: Verifies `dist/` stays in sync with `src/commands/`
- **Build check on PR/push**: Fails if `./build.sh` produces uncommitted changes

#### Visual Improvements

- **Melted steel gradient**: Red → orange → yellow → white color scheme for ASCII banner
- **SVG banner for GitHub**: `assets/banner.svg` with same gradient colors
- **Cleaner TUI**: Simplified instructions, highlighted keys

### Changed

- **Directory structure**: Commands moved from `commands/` to `src/commands/` (source of truth)
- **Installation targets**: Installer copies from `dist/{platform}/` not source
- **README**: Updated with new install instructions and SVG banner

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-13

### Added

#### Repository Context

- **`.fpf/context.md`**: Created by `/fpf-0-init` to define the "Base Slice" (Tech Stack, Scale, Constraints).
- **Context Awareness**: All commands (`hypothesize`, `research`, `test`) now read this file to ground decisions.
- **CLAUDE.md Update**: Instructions for Claude to check `.fpf/context.md` first.

#### Enhanced Hypothesis Structure

- **Formality (F-Score)**: Added `formality: [0-9]` to hypothesis frontmatter.
- **NQD Tags**: Added `novelty` and `complexity` to hypothesis frontmatter for diversity tracking.
- **Strict Method/Work Split**: Hypothesis body restructured into "1. The Method (Design-Time)" and "2. The Validation (Run-Time)" to enforce A.15.

#### Documentation

- **F-Score Definitions**: Added explanation of F0-F9 ranges to README.
- **TODOs**: Added roadmap items for deeper NQD and Method/Work integration.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-13

### Added

#### Agentic Initialization

- **`.fpf/context.md`**: New foundational file that grounds all reasoning in the project's specific reality.

#### Repository Context Integration

- **Context Awareness**: All commands (`hypothesize`, `research`, `test`) now read `.fpf/context.md` to make decisions relevant.
- **CLAUDE.md Update**: Instructions for Claude to check `.fpf/context.md` first.

### Notes

This was the initial implementation based on the First Principles Framework (FPF) specification. The focus was on establishing the core workflow and making FPF accessible to developers through Claude Code commands.

Key design decisions:

- Commands over subagents (human must be in the loop)
- File-based persistence (git-trackable)
- Minimal tooling (no external dependencies)
- Advisory guidance (not enforced gates)

---

## Upgrade Notes

### 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

**Session file format changed.** Existing `.fpf/session.md` files should be updated to include:

- Phase Transitions Log table
- Valid Phase Transitions diagram reference

**Evidence files should add:**

- `congruence:` block for external evidence
- `valid_until:` if not already present

**No breaking changes to:**

- Knowledge directory structure
- DRR format (only additions)
- Command names and basic arguments

**Recommended migration:**

1. Run `/fpf-decay` to identify evidence needing validity dates
2. Add congruence assessment to existing external evidence
3. No need to re-run completed cycles
