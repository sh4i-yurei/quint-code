  - Also checks: trailing whitespace, end-of-file, yaml syntax, large files, merge conflicts, private keys.

### Changed

- **Updated FPF Commands**: Commands now leverage new MCP tools for computed data:
  - `/q4-audit`: Now calls `quint_calculate_r` and `quint_audit_tree` before recording findings.
  - `/q5-decide`: Now uses `quint_calculate_r` for final R_eff comparison before decision.
  - `/q-audit`: Updated to use visualization tools.
  - `/q-decay`: Updated to use `quint_check_decay` for proactive decay detection.
  - `/q-status`: Now proactively checks for expired evidence.

- **SQLite Driver Migration**: Replaced CGO-based `mattn/go-sqlite3` with pure Go `modernc.org/sqlite`.
  - Enables `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds for simplified cross-compilation.
  - Cross-compilation now works for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/*, windows/amd64.
  - Unblocks single-runner GoReleaser builds.
  - No functional changes to database behavior.

- **FSM Phase Derivation**: `CanTransition()` now uses `GetPhase()` (derived from DB) instead of `State.Phase`.
  - Phase transitions are validated against actual database state.
  - Hardens FPF enforcement against state.json manipulation.

### Fixed

- **Evidence Decay Bug**: Evidence was stored with `NULL` `valid_until`, making `/q-decay` always report "no expired evidence."
  - `ManageEvidence` now sets a default 90-day validity period when `validUntil` is empty.
  - Affects all evidence added via `quint_verify`, `quint_test`, and `quint_audit`.

- **Go Module Import Paths**: Standardized import paths to use the correct module name across all packages. (PR #16, @blib)

## [4.0.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **MCP Server Architecture**:
  - This release introduces the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server as the core of Quint Code, replacing the previous prompt-only approach. The server provides structured tools for AI assistants to interact with the FPF knowledge base.
  - The MCP server has been restructured into `cmd` and `internal` packages for better organization and maintainability.
- **New Commands**:
  - `/q-audit`: Visualize assurance tree with R-scores.
  - `/q-decay`: Calculate epistemic debt from expired evidence.
- **Command Updates**:
  - `/q-actualize`: Reconcile the knowledge base with recent code changes. This command has been updated for better performance and accuracy.
- **Renamed Commands**:
  - `/q2-check` is now `/q2-verify`.
  - `/q3-research` and `/q3-test` are consolidated into `/q3-validate`.
  - `/q1-add` has been added for manually adding hypotheses.
- **SQLite Database (`quint.db`)**:
  - The project now uses SQLite for deterministic FPF, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.
  - `holons` table now includes `scope`, `kind`, and `cached_r_score` columns to support advanced FPF features.
  - `evidence` table now includes a `valid_until` column for evidence decay tracking.
  - `relations` table now includes a `congruence_level` column for WLNK calculation.
- **Trust & Assurance Calculator (B.3)**:
  - Implemented the FPF B.3 standard for calculating trust and assurance.
  - **Weakest Link (WLNK)**: R-score is now capped by the lowest-scoring dependency in the evidence chain.
  - **Congruence Penalty**: Low-congruence relations between artifacts now reduce the overall reliability score.
  - **Evidence Decay**: Expired evidence, as determined by the `valid_until` field, now penalizes the R-score, introducing the concept of "epistemic debt."
  - **Cycle Detection**: The calculator now detects and flags circular dependencies in the evidence graph.
- **Typed Reasoning (Kind-CAL)**:
  - Hypotheses are now classified by `kind` as either `system` (for code and architecture) or `episteme` (for knowledge and theory).
  - Validation logic now branches based on the hypothesis kind, allowing for more targeted and relevant analysis.
- **Characteristic Space (C.16)**:
  - Success metrics are now defined upfront, before testing, as part of the `Characteristic Space`.
  - These metrics are measured during the induction phase (`/q3-validate`).
  - The results are recorded in the Design Rationale Record (DRR) for full traceability.
- **CI/CD**:
  - A new GitHub Actions workflow has been added to automate the build and release process.
- **Testing**:
  - Added integration tests for the assurance calculator to ensure correctness and stability.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Improved error handling to surface previously-silent errors with warnings.

### Changed

- **Project Directory**: Renamed from `.fpf` to `.quint`. Migration: run `/q-actualize` to migrate, then delete `.fpf`.
- **Multi-platform Support**:
  - Installer now supports Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI.
  - Commands are now sourced from `src/commands/` and built to platform-specific formats in `dist/`.

### Removed

- **Redundant Agents**: Removed legacy standalone agent files for a cleaner codebase.

---

## [3.4.0] - 2025-12-15

### Security: Executable Phase Gating

#### Physics-First Enforcement (`/q1-hypothesize`)

- **Vulnerability Closed:** Previous prompts used "soft" text instructions to prevent adding hypotheses mid-cycle, which "helpful" AI models would bypass.
- **Executable Gate:** Now injects a bash script that checks `.quint/session.md`. If the phase is locked (Deduction/Induction complete), the script exits with `1`.
- **Hard Stop:** The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to treat a script failure as a hard stop ("Physics says no"), preventing "helpfulness bias" overrides.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added: Legacy Project Repair

#### Smart Initialization (`/q0-init`)

- **Self-Healing Capability:** The init command now detects incomplete FPF setups (e.g., legacy projects missing `context.md` from v2.x).
- **Deterministic Diagnostic:** Injects a bash script to verify file existence before deciding actions, preventing AI "hallucinated" skips.
- **Repair Mode:** If `.quint/` exists but is incomplete, it triggers a surgical repair (generating only missing files) while preserving existing session data.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added: Process Hardening & Flexibility

#### Strict Phase Gating (FPF Integrity)

- **Hard Block in `/q1-hypothesize`:** Explicitly forbids generating new hypotheses if the cycle has passed Deduction. This prevents the "Helpfulness Bias" vulnerability where AI assistants might break process integrity to be "nice".
- **Conditional Logic in `/q2-check`:** The cycle phase now only advances to `DEDUCTION_COMPLETE` when *all* active L0 hypotheses are resolved. If any remain unchecked, the door stays open for extensions.

#### New Command: `/q1-extend`

- **Legitimate Extension Path:** A dedicated command to add a missed hypothesis during the `ABDUCTION_COMPLETE` phase.
- **Safety Rails:** Strictly blocked once `DEDUCTION_COMPLETE` is reached, ensuring evidence integrity (WLNK validity) during testing.

### Changed

- **Updated `/q-status`:** State machine visualization now includes the `(q1-extend)` loop.
- **Refined `/q3-test` & `/q3-research`:** Reinforced checks to ensure testing only happens after deduction is fully complete.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added: Deep Reasoning Capabilities

#### Context Slicing (A.2.6)

- **Structured Context:** `.quint/context.md` is now structured into explicit slices:
  - **Slice: Grounding** (Infrastructure, Region)
  - **Slice: Tech Stack** (Language, Frameworks)
  - **Slice: Constraints** (Compliance, Budget, Team)
- **Context-Aware Init:** `/q0-init` now scans `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, etc., to auto-populate slices.

#### Explicit Role Injection (A.2)

- **Role-Swapping Prompts:** Commands now enforce specific FPF roles to prevent "AI drift":
  - `/q1-hypothesize`: **ExplorerRole** (Creative, Abductive)
  - `/q2-check`: **LogicianRole** (Strict, Deductive)
  - `/q4-audit`: **AuditorRole** (Adversarial, Normative)

#### Context Drift Analysis

- **New Audit Step:** `/q4-audit` now includes a mandatory **Context Drift Check**.
- **Validation:** Verifies that hypotheses generated in step 1 still match the constraints in step 4 (preventing "works on my machine" architecture).

### Changed

- **Command Prompts:** Updated `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, `q4` to enforce the new reasoning standards.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-14

### Major Breaking Change: Rebrand to Quint Code

**Crucible Code is now Quint Code.**

### Why the Name Change?

1. **Avoid Collision:** "Crucible" is an existing code review tool by Atlassian. We want a distinct identity.
2. **Not Just Code:** This tool melts *ideas* and *reasoning*, not just source code.
3. **The "Quintessence":** Anatoly Levenchuk described this project as a "distillate of FPF" (~5% of the full framework). It is the *quintessence*—the concentrated essence of the methodology.
4. **The Invariant Quintet:** FPF is built on five invariants (IDEM, COMM, LOC, WLNK, MONO). Quint Code enforces a rigid 5-step sequence (`q1`–`q5`) to preserve these invariants in your reasoning.

### Changed

- **Project Name**: `crucible-code` → `quint-code`
- **Commands Prefix**: `/fpf-*` → `/q*`
  - `/q0-init`
  - `/q1-hypothesize`
  - `/q2-check`
  - `/q3-test`
  - `/q3-research`
  - `/q4-audit`
  - `/q5-decide`
- **Utility Commands**:
  - `/fpf-status` → `/q-status`
  - `/fpf-query` → `/q-query`
  - `/fpf-decay` → `/q-decay`
  - `/fpf-discard` → `/q-reset` (Renamed to avoid tab-completion clash with decay)

### Migration Guide

1. **Delete old commands**: Run the uninstall script or manually delete `~/.claude/commands/fpf-*`.
2. **Install new commands**: Run `./install.sh`.
3. **Update mental model**: Think "Quintet" (5 invariants, 5 steps).

This was the initial implementation based on the First Principles Framework (FPF) specification. The focus was on establishing the core workflow and making FPF accessible to developers through Claude Code commands.

Key design decisions:

- Commands over subagents (human must be in the loop)
- File-based persistence (git-trackable)
- Minimal tooling (no external dependencies)
- Advisory guidance (not enforced gates)

---

## Upgrade Notes

### 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

**Session file format changed.** Existing `.quint/session.md` files should be updated to include:

- Phase Transitions Log table
- Valid Phase Transitions diagram reference

**Evidence files should add:**

- `congruence:` block for external evidence
- `valid_until:` if not already present

**No breaking changes to:**

- Knowledge directory structure
- DRR format (only additions)
- Command names and basic arguments

**Recommended migration:**

1. Run `/fpf-decay` to identify evidence needing validity dates
2. Add congruence assessment to existing external evidence
3. No need to re-run completed cycles
