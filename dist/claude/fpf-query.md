# FPF Query

## Purpose

Search project knowledge base for relevant epistemes, evidence, and decisions.

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS.topic` — Search term(s)
- `$ARGUMENTS.level` — Optional filter (L0, L1, L2, invalid, all)

## Process

### 1. Search Knowledge Files

```bash
# Search across all knowledge levels
grep -r -l -i "$TOPIC" .fpf/knowledge/

# Or filter by level
grep -r -l -i "$TOPIC" .fpf/knowledge/L2/  # Only verified
```

### 2. Search Decisions

```bash
grep -r -l -i "$TOPIC" .fpf/decisions/
```

### 3. Search Evidence

```bash
grep -r -l -i "$TOPIC" .fpf/evidence/
```

### 4. Compile Results

For each match, extract:
- File path
- Title (from frontmatter or first heading)
- Status/Level
- Relevance snippet
- WLNK R_eff (if available)
- Validity status

## Output Format

```markdown
## Knowledge Query: "[topic]"

### Summary

| Category | Matches | Confidence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| L2 (Verified) | [N] | High |
| L1 (Reasoned) | [N] | Medium |
| L0 (Observations) | [N] | Low |
| Invalid (Disproved) | [N] | — |
| Decisions (DRRs) | [N] | — |
| Evidence | [N] | — |

**Overall confidence for "[topic]":** [High / Medium / Low / None]

---

### Verified Knowledge (L2) — Highest Confidence

[Most reliable — empirically tested]

**[episteme-name]**
- **File:** `.fpf/knowledge/L2/[file].md`
- **Summary:** [Relevant snippet or summary]
- **Evidence:** [linked evidence files]
- **Decided in:** [DRR reference if any]
- **Valid until:** [date or "no expiry set"]

---

### Reasoned Knowledge (L1) — Medium Confidence

[Logically verified, not empirically tested]

**[episteme-name]**
- **File:** `.fpf/knowledge/L1/[file].md`
- **Summary:** [Relevant snippet]
- **Status:** Passed deduction, awaiting empirical verification
- **Needs:** `/fpf-3-test` or `/fpf-3-research`

---

### Observations (L0) — Low Confidence

[Unverified — treat with caution]

**[episteme-name]**
- **File:** `.fpf/knowledge/L0/[file].md`
- **Summary:** [Relevant snippet]
- **Status:** Hypothesis / Observation — not yet verified
- **Needs:** `/fpf-2-check`

---

### Disproved (Invalid) — For Learning

[These were wrong — kept to avoid repeating mistakes]

**[episteme-name]**
- **File:** `.fpf/knowledge/invalid/[file].md`
- **Why invalid:** [reason]
- **Learning:** [what we learned]

---

### Related Decisions

**DRR-[NNN]: [title]**
- **File:** `.fpf/decisions/DRR-[NNN].md`
- **Date:** [date]
- **Relates to query:** [how it relates]
- **Status:** [ACCEPTED / SUPERSEDED]

---

### Related Evidence

**[evidence-name]**
- **File:** `.fpf/evidence/[file].md`
- **Type:** [internal / external]
- **Congruence:** [high/medium/low or N/A for internal]
- **Valid until:** [date]
- **Finding:** [what it tested/showed]

---

### Confidence Assessment

**For "[topic]":**

| Indicator | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| L2 matches exist | ✓/✗ |
| Evidence is fresh | ✓/⚠/✗ |
| Multiple sources | ✓/✗ |
| High congruence | ✓/⚠/✗ |

**Verdict:** [High confidence — can rely on this knowledge]
           [Medium confidence — verify before critical decisions]
           [Low confidence — needs more investigation]
           [No knowledge — topic not investigated yet]
```

## No Results

```markdown
## Knowledge Query: "[topic]"

**No matches found in knowledge base.**

### What This Means

The topic "[topic]" has not been investigated in this project's FPF knowledge base.

### Suggestions

1. **Check spelling** — Try alternative terms or synonyms
2. **Broaden search** — Use more general keywords
3. **Start investigation** — If this is important:
   ```
   /fpf-1-hypothesize "[topic]-related question"
   ```

### Related (Fuzzy Matches)

[If partial matches exist, suggest them:]
- "[similar-term-1]" — [N] matches
- "[similar-term-2]" — [N] matches

Try: `/fpf-query [similar-term]`
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Find everything about caching
/fpf-query caching

# Only verified knowledge about auth
/fpf-query auth --level L2

# What do we know about performance?
/fpf-query performance

# Check specific technology
/fpf-query redis

# Find by decision
/fpf-query database selection
```

## Integration with Decision Making

**Before starting new FPF cycle, query first:**

```markdown
## Pre-Investigation Check

Before: /fpf-1-hypothesize "should we use Redis?"
Do:     /fpf-query redis
        /fpf-query caching
        /fpf-query session storage

[Check if we already have verified knowledge on this topic]

Results:
- If L2 knowledge exists → May not need full ADI cycle
- If related DRR exists → Check if still valid, reference it
- If L1 exists → May only need induction phase
- If nothing → Full cycle needed
```

## Confidence Levels Explained

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **High** | L2 knowledge with fresh evidence | Safe to rely on |
| **Medium** | L1 knowledge or aging L2 | Verify for critical decisions |
| **Low** | Only L0 or stale evidence | Needs investigation |
| **None** | No matches | Start fresh investigation |
